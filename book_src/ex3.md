# Objects

Now that we can get user input there's a *lot* of things that we could learn about next.
Probably we should focus on how to improve our drawing abilities.
Most of the GBA's drawing abilities involve either the 4 background layers, or the 128 objects ("OBJ" for short).
The background layers let you draw a few "big" things, and the objects let you draw many "small" things.
In a typical 2d-platformer, the immobile parts of the level would be drawn using a background layer, and the moving platforms and enemies would be drawn using objects.

Using objects isn't too complex, and they can be combined with any of the GBA's different background modes, so it feels like a great thing to learn first.
